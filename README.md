# Vue 3 + Vite + Tailwind

This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

## Recommended IDE Setup

- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=johnsoncodehk.volar)

## Why typescript?

A static type system can help prevent many potential runtime errors as applications grow, which is why Vue 3 is written in TypeScript. This means you don't need any additional tooling to use TypeScript with Vue - it has first-class citizen support.

## How to start (local/development)

### Using Git (recommended)

1.  Clone the project from github.
