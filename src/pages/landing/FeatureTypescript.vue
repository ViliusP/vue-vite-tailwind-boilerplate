      <span class="font-bold">JavaScript and More.</span>
      TypeScript adds additional syntax to JavaScript to support a tighter
      integration with your editor. Catch errors early in your editor. <br />
      <br />
      <span class="font-bold"> A Result You Can Trust.</span>
      TypeScript code converts to JavaScript, which runs anywhere JavaScript
      runs: In a browser, on Node.js or Deno and in your apps. <br />
      <br />
      <span class="font-bold"> Safety at Scale.</span>
      TypeScript understands JavaScript and uses type inference to give you
      great tooling without additional code. <br />
      <br />
      <span class="font-bold"> Why Vue3 + Typescript?</span>
      A static type system can help prevent many potential runtime errors as
      applications grow, which is why Vue 3 is written in TypeScript. This means
      you don't need any additional tooling to use TypeScript with Vue - it has
      first-class citizen support.
      <br />
      You can also do in old-fashion - use Javascript or you can use both. Using
      this starter you are not obligated to use TS.
